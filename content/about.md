I am a sixth-year graduate student in astronomy at Harvard University.

I am primarily interested in the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. I use idealized simulations to study specific questions about the Milky Way. I have shown with a simulation of a Milky Way-like barred galaxy that the braking interaction between the bar and the dark matter halo [could be arrested by the Milky Way's gas phase](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...953..173B/abstract), explaining how it is both old and fast.

I have recently been interested in the formation of the "abundance bimodality" - the separation between stars with high amounts of alpha-elements (e.g., magnesium) and low amounts. By running numerical experiments with these idealized simulations, I have argued that such a bimodality is the natural consequence of a [brief quiescent period in the Milky Way's history](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240707985B/abstract). This could be induced by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus about eight billion years ago.

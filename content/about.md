I am a third-year graduate student in astronomy at Harvard University.

I am primarily interested in the interpretation of complicated datasets with numerical simulations. This has led me to my interests in the Milky Way and the Epoch of Reionization, both of which either currently have or will soon have enormous datasets with no clear path towards their interpretation. As I begin my PhD, these will be my focus.
